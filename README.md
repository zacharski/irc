Welcome to your IRC project on Cloud9 IDE!

####Dependencies
`sudo easy_install flask-socketio`

# IRC Project 1

## Partner (or Individual) task

### Piazza & In-Person Guidelines
1. Feel free to discuss how the provided code works.
2. You are not to show to any part of your code --even elided versions of your code-- to anyone.
  * If you are looking for help you cannot show your code
  * If you are providing help to someone you cannot show your code.
3. Feel free to share online resources (other than those that are a direct cut-and-paste solution to his task).
4. Feel free to answer questions that are not code based. For ex., *I think you created a new workspace and forgot to install flask -> sudo easy_install flask*
5. Any question/answer exchanges that are entirely in English are fine (i.e., not sharing code snippets).


### Deliverables for First Sprint
1. Login working -- only people who are logged in can chat.
2. Messages stored in database. 
3. When a user logs in they will see some list of previous messages. 
4. Search. I can search for a particular term and see the results.
 
### You must host your code on github

#
Things to check if it isn't working.
Did we git add the file?
Did we git commit the file?
Did we git push?
Did you do a pull request?
Did I merge it on github?
Did I actually pull it?
