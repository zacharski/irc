Welcome to your IRC project on Cloud9 IDE!

####Dependencies
`sudo easy_install flask-socketio`

# IRC Project 1

## Partner (or Individual) task

### Piazza & In-Person Guidelines
1. Feel free to discuss how the provided code works.
2. You are not to show to any part of your code --even elided versions of your code-- to anyone.
  * If you are looking for help you cannot show your code
  * If you are providing help to someone you cannot show your code.
3. Feel free to share online resources (other than those that are a direct cut-and-paste solution to his task).
4. Feel free to answer questions that are not code based. For ex., *I think you created a new workspace and forgot to install flask -> sudo easy_install flask*
5. Any question/answer exchanges that are entirely in English are fine (i.e., not sharing code snippets).


### Deliverables for First Sprint
1. Login working -- only people who are logged in can chat.
2. Messages stored in database. 
3. When a user logs in they will see some list of previous messages. 
4. Search. I can search for a particular term and see the results.

### Deliverables for Second Sprint
1. the chat supports multiple rooms (EXAMPLE CODE: https://bitbucket.org/zacharski/irc.git)
2. Users are subscribed to a set of rooms and cannot access rooms that they are not subscribed to.
3. When a user searches for something the search takes place only in posts in rooms they are subscribed to
4. all tables in 3NF
Earn more XP by implementing other features that rely on a db. (for ex, a register an account popup)

Still need to add stuff from Michelle's paper. She scribbled things while he was talking about stuff.
 
### You must host your code on github


we still need to :
    cake is great!
    - do search stuff
    - make it fail gracefully when user is not in the thing

I'm pretty sure this isn't right. Stuff down there at least. Not running server from .js what.

Welcome to your Node.js project on Cloud9 IDE!

This chat example showcases how to use `socket.io` with a static `express` server.

## Running the server

1) Open `server.js` and start the app by clicking on the "Run" button in the top menu.

2) Alternatively you can launch the app from the Terminal:

    $ node server.js

Once the server is running, open the project in the shape of 'https://projectname-username.c9.io/'. As you enter your name, watch the Users list (on the left) update. Once you press Enter or Send, the message is shared with all connected clients.
